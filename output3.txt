CRL.P No. 200426 of 2025
Petitioner No.1 is the President of Modern Education
Society. Petitioner No.2 is the surety for the loan of which
petitioner No.1 had borrowed. Petitioner No.1, being a
President of the said Society, had availed loan of
Rs.1,95,00,000/- from respondent No.2 for the purpose of
development of its educational institution. Petitioner No.2
offered his land bearing Sy.No.545/1 measuring 05 acres
35 guntas situated at Sindagi village, as security. The
respondent-Bank after obtaining Encumbrance Certificate
for 15 years and an undertaking from petitioner No.2 not
to alienate the said property, sanctioned the loan to
petitioner No.1.
Petitioner No.1 became defaulter and therefore,
respondent No.2 proceeded to recover the amount from
petitioner No.2. On verification, the Bank came to know
that the property which was mortgaged had already been
sold to one Sunil Hallur under the registered sale deed
dated 27.06.2016. Hence, the Bank lodged the complaint
against the petitioners.

3. Heard Sri.Yashas S.Dikshit, learned counsel for
the petitioners, Sri.Jamadar Shahabuddin, learned High
Court Government Pleader for respondent No.1 and
Sri.Shivanand V.Pattanashetti, learned counsel for
respondent No.2.
4. It is the submission of the learned counsel for
the petitioners that the offences alleged against the
petitioners are neither punishable with death nor
imprisonment for life. The petitioners are permanent
residents of Sindagi Taluk and aged about 50 and 55 years
respectively.
5. It is further submitted that though there are
some allegations made against them that the petitioners
have cheated the Bank and obtained loan of
Rs.1,95,00,000/-, the fact remains that the said loan is
stated to have been sanctioned on 29.03.2021 however,
the property which was offered as security to the Bank

NC: 2025:KHC-K:2145
CRL.P No. 200426 of 2025
was sold on 27.06.2016 i.e., much prior to the sanctioning
of loan.
6.
It is further submitted that the officials of the
Bank must have colluded with the petitioners and should
have sanctioned the loan knowingly that it was already
sold to some other person. It is needless to say that the
bankers have verified the document before sanctioning the
loan.
7. It is further submitted that now the complainant
has adopted the coercive method to recover the amount
from the petitioners which is untenable and therefore, the
petitioners may be enlarged on bail.
8. Per contra, learned High Court Government
Pleader vehemently submitted that petitioner Nos.1 and 2
have committed fraud to the Bank and obtained loan by
producing the fake documents as security. The public
money is involved in the said scheme or scam. Therefore,

6 -
NC: 2025:KHC-K:2145
CRL.P No. 200426 of 2025
it is not appropriate to grant bail. Making such
submissions, he prays to dismiss the petition.
9. Having heard the learned counsel for the
respective parties and also perused the averments of the
complaint and FIR, it appears from the record that loan
stated to have been sanctioned on 29.03.2021 obtaining
the property documents of petitioner No.2 as security
however, the sale deed in respect of the said property was
executed on 27.06.2016. Having considered the facts and
circumstances of the case, it is appropriate to grant bail to
the petitioners by imposing suitable conditions which
would take care of the apprehension expressed by the
prosecution.
10. Accordingly, I pass the following:
ORDER
The Criminal Petition is allowed.
The respondent/Police is directed to release the
petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest in Crime
